This project explores the impact of various hyperparameters on the classification accuracy of a neural network. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) was used as the base model, and optimal hyperparameters were searched for using a dataset of individuals with diabetes. The influence of the following hyperparameters was studied: neural network topology, optimizer, learning rate, and activation function. More information is available in the report.pdf.

This project was implemented in the summer semester of 2025 in the subject of NN (Neural networks). The project was carried out by Dmytro Skrypchenko
